<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Taylor Flewelling, and I am currently a senior at Michigan State University. I am majoring in Media and Information with a concentration in Information, Management, and Design for Society. Post graduation, I hope to work in a role where I can work with digital media and influencer marketing.</p>
<p>My hope is that this course helps me become more comfortable with HTML and CSS, so I can apply these skills to my current internship position. I have an upcoming project that is designing landing pages for follow up communications, and I am confident this class will help to improve my skillset. </p>
<h3>Things I Love</h3>
