            <p>This year has had the average person in their home much more than we typically would be. As a result of that, many of us have found our eating habits have become unhealthier, and our fitness levels have decreased. This blogpost will contain three healthy habits you can build into your everyday life to fight off the quarantine weight gain.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go on a 30 minute walk daily</li>
                <p>Daily walking, and even a brisk jog does wonders to exercise your cardiovascular system. Not only is this good for your overall health and wellness, but it will likely motivate you to be more active in your everyday lifestyle. 
                </p>
                <li>Eat the Rainbow</li>
                <p>Being at home more is a great excuse to brush up on your cooking skills! There are many resources online to help guide you in the direction of easy recipes that can take anywhere from 15-30 minutes. Always try to include fruits and veggies in your everyday recipes, and a good source of protein as well. My tip is to eat fruits with breakfast and lunch, and a vegetable with dinner. Find produce that you like to make it more enjoyable!
                </p>
                <li>Try out New Exercises</li>
                <p>Exercising provides not only great physical benefits, but tremendous mental benefits as well. If you are stuck at home more than you normally would be, it is a great idea to implement an exercise schedule that you enjoy. This can be anything from biking, yoga, weight training, whatever you enjoy! The endorphins you will get will be great for your mind and body. 
                </p>
                <p>Keep your eye out for future posts for more health and wellness tips!
